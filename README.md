# Project-P-Cubed
Using OpenCV and a Raspberry Pi, allow people with paraplegia to control a piano pedal with facial gestures

# Usage
Two GPIOs are needed, but only 1 GPIO is needed to control it just keep one of them grounded
Rewiring is required, connector wire to foot pedal is required
Obviously, a camera for the Raspberry Pi is needed

# Future Updates
Very unlikely, however, feel free to message me if you'd like to learn more
